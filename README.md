# PhysioPxAdmin
Administer your physiotherapy practice, especially in Germany

This program is only useful, if you are a physiotherapist in germany. Therefore the whole descript will be in german, please excuse. If you have similar monsters in your public administration like we in germany (Spitzenverband der gesetzlichen Krankenkassen, Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss etc.), please leave a note an i will translate all description into english. But i am afraid, that in know anything over the administrations in other european countrys nor in the rest of the world, except of that they are sometimes disturbing ...
